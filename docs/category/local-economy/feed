				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>At the end of 2023 William Morris Big Local put a call out to find a local film maker to shine a light on the local independent businesses we have on the doorstep, many of which are tucked away out of sight and mind. The aim of this piece is to highlight and celebrate the amazing value that local businesses provide to the local community, the end result being that we are all inspired to use our local businesses even more thereby supporting the Local Economy.</p>
<p>We are delighted to have commissioned Chris Eyre &#8211; <a href="https://www.chriseyrefilm.co.uk">chriseyrefilm.co.uk</a> &#8211; pictured above, to work on the documentary entitled Hidden Independents and he will be working on the project from April 2024 with a launch of the film scheduled for September 2024.</p>
<p>And now, over to Chris to explain more……………</p>
<p>“Hello, I&#8217;m Chris and I&#8217;m excited to be working on this project. But I am most excited about hearing from YOU.</p>
<p>I want to feature businesses that have a real, day-to-day impact on local residents&#8217; lives. Perhaps it&#8217;s the green grocer who always makes you laugh, the chemist who asks after your health or the barista who entertains your kids while you wait for your latte. Or maybe it&#8217;s your friend who runs an online business from home, an artist who works hard to keep a dwindling artform or craft alive, or someone who does exceptional work making the area a better place to live.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 18px;">I&#8217;m open to all and any suggestions. They just have to be primarily based in the </span><a href="../../map-of-the-area" style="font-size: 18px;">William Morris area&#8221;</a></p>
<p>Nominate your favourite business at the link in the red box below or record a short audio message <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong><a href="https://www.speakpipe.com/hiddenindependents">here</a></strong><a href="https://www.speakpipe.com/hiddenindependents">.</a></span> <a href="https://www.speakpipe.com/hiddenindependents"></a>It&#8217;ll take less a minute!</p>
<p>If you have any questions or thoughts about the project, please email <a href="mailto:hiddenindependents@gmail.com">hiddenindependents@gmail.com</a></p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p>Three new projects have been created at WM Big Local with the overall aim of raising visibility of local independent businesses and helping money circulate around the local community.</p></div>

				<div class="et_pb_text_inner"><p><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">A strong local economy is so important for making a healthy community and a little can go a long way when it comes to how you spend your money. We’ve long been champions of shop local schemes and supporting independent businesses and now we’ve developed three initiatives that might just see individuals and independent businesses boost their income. </span></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 18px;"></strong></p>
<p><strong style="font-size: 18px;">1. Hidden Independents</strong></p>
<p><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">We are looking to commission a local person with the skills to deliver a docu-series about local independent businesses and the people behind them. Entitled “Hidden Independents” the series will be made up of 10 short features that will see you working with brilliant local businesses and give them a spotlight to tell their story and raise their profile. </span></p>
<p><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">More info <a href="../../project/hidden-independents"><strong>here</strong></a></span></p>
<p><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"><strong></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>2. Around the World in William Morris</strong></p>
<p><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"></span><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none">We are compiling a fun interactive map of the diverse independent businesses based in the William Morris Ward. This map will be both digital and printed and encourage people to explore the world through the businesses based right on their doorstep. This might be food, clothing, toys, games, equipment or anything sold locally that represents different parts of the world (including the good ole U.K of course!)</span></p>
<p><strong></strong>More info <a href="../../project/around-the-world-in-william-morris"><strong>here</strong></a><span class="OYPEnA text-decoration-none text-strikethrough-none"></span></p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>3. Priory Court Community Market</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>On Saturday 9th December we will be hosting a Community Market a Priory Court Community Centre, E17 5NB. This will give the opportunity for emerging businesses to raise their profile in the community and sell directly to the public face to face. In addition to this individuals will be able to sell items in a fun table top sale atmosphere alongside charities and community groups.<strong></strong></p>
