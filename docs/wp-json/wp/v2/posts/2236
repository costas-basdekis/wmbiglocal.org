The roundels have been created of hundreds of tiles, some of which had been created by local residents. This beautiful community collaboration shines a light on the industrial and creative history of Blackhorse Lane as well as the lives and experiences of local people.<\/p>\n<p>This creative project was developed by artist Maud Milton and William Morris Big Local and was backed by Transport for London (TfL), Waltham Forest and Taylor Wimpey.<\/p>\n<p>The series of miniature TfL roundels have been mounted on the concrete pillars at the rear part of the station. The roundels are incredibly beautiful and tactile and it\u2019s a wonder to touch the pieces and feel the result of tiles being fired at over 1200 degrees and glazed to make the final piece. Those who look up close will be able to take in the beauty of each of the roundels in all their fascinating detail and see the collection of designs, messages and themes that the community has put together.<\/p>\n<p>Roy O\u2019Neil, TfL\u2019s General Manager for London Overground expressed that \u201cwe know our stations are an important part of the community so it\u2019s fantastic that Maud Milton along with local community groups and residents are contributing to these new colourful mosaics at Blackhorse Road station. These unique roundels will provide a splash of colour for all our customers to enjoy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Maud Milton said: \u201cI\u2019m excited to see these unique roundels for this station and community up in situ, getting such a lot of love and appreciation from commuters, locals and roundel fans. There is a different twist at Blackhorse Road Station to all the other projects we have made. The BHR series is a roundel trail of 16: one large roundel and 15 small roundels with their unique name-bars in key parts of the station.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Councillor Ahsan Khan, Deputy Leader for Waltham Forest Council and Cabinet Member for Housing and Regeneration, said: \u201cThese vibrant mosaics, co-created by residents, is a fantastic way to showcase local talent for everyone in the area to enjoy. The art compliments the recent \u00a31m improvements to the station which was delivered by the Council in partnership with the GLA and TfL.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>See the roundels for yourself at Blackhorse Road Station. The majority of the artwork is situated before the barriers so you don\u2019t even need to make a journey to appreciate them.<\/p>\n<p>For more information with this project and the many beautiful mosaics Maud Milton makes you can follow her on Instagram @maudmilton and at artyface.co.uk.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_gallery gallery_ids=&#8221;2246,2247,2055,2054&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.20.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][\/et_pb_gallery][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>New roundel artworks were unveiled this April at Blackhorse Road station with a celebration event to mark the occasion.Mosaic roundels were designed and put together by a local artist Maud Milton.
