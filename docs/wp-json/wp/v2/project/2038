This beautiful community collaboration shines a light on the industrial and creative history of Blackhorse Lane as well as the lives and experiences of local people.<\/p>\n<p>In a new twist on the station roundel concept Maud has produced for the first time a series of miniature Transport for London (TfL) roundels which have been mounted on the concrete pillars at the rear part of the station. The 12 individual roundels make for an intriguing and interactive gallery.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you give them a quick glance as you pass by on your commute or stop and get lost in the detail, they leave a wonderful imprint on the mind. It\u2019s not just visually that they are stunning either. The roundels are incredibly tactile and it\u2019s a wonder to touch the pieces and feel the result of tiles being fired at over 1200 degrees and glazed to make the final piece.<\/p>\n<p>Those who look up close will be able to take in the beauty of each of the roundels in all their fascinating detail and see the collection of designs, messages and themes that the community has put together.<\/p>\n<p>Roy O\u2019Neil, TfL\u2019s General Manager for London Overground expressed that \u201cwe know our stations are an important part of the community so it\u2019s fantastic that Maud Milton along with local community groups and residents are contributing to these new colourful mosaics at Blackhorse Road station. These unique roundels will provide a splash of colour for all our customers to enjoy.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>See the roundels for yourself at Blackhorse Road Station. The majority of the artwork is situated before the barriers so you don\u2019t even need to make a journey to appreciate them.<\/p>\n<p>There are however a bonus three mini roundels situated on the Overground Station for anyone making a journey in the direction of Barking.<\/p>\n<p>For more information with this project and the many beautiful mosaics Maud Milton makes you can follow her on Instagram @maudmilton and at artyface.co.uk<\/p>\n<p>This project has been made possible with the generous support and funding of William Morris Big Local, London Borough Waltham Forest, The Collective, Taylor Wimpey and Transport for London.<\/p>\n<p>[\/et_pb_text][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section][et_pb_section fb_built=&#8221;1&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_row _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_column type=&#8221;4_4&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][et_pb_gallery gallery_ids=&#8221;2051,2052,2053,2054,2055,2056,2057,2058&#8243; _builder_version=&#8221;4.18.0&#8243; _module_preset=&#8221;default&#8221; global_colors_info=&#8221;{}&#8221; theme_builder_area=&#8221;post_content&#8221;][\/et_pb_gallery][\/et_pb_column][\/et_pb_row][\/et_pb_section]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>East London Artist Maud Milton has brought to life a series of bespoke and beautiful mosaics to Blackhorse Road station with locals, creating the hundreds of tiles that go into her work.Blackhorse Road Station has become home to a collection of roundels created by Maud Milton with members of the community helping to reflect Blackhorse [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":2045,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"closed","template":"","meta":{"_et_pb_use_builder":"on","_et_pb_old_content":"[et_pb_section fb_built=\"1\" _builder_version=\"4.15\" _module_preset=\"default\" custom_padding=\"30px||30px||false|false\" global_colors_info=\"{}\" theme_builder_area=\"post_content\"][et_pb_row _builder_version=\"4.15\" _module_preset=\"default\" global_colors_info=\"{}\" theme_builder_area=\"post_content\"][et_pb_column type=\"4_4\" _builder_version=\"4.15\" _module_preset=\"default\" global_colors_info=\"{}\" theme_builder_area=\"post_content\"][et_pb_text module_class=\"intro-text\" _builder_version=\"4.15\" _module_preset=\"default\" global_colors_info=\"{}\" theme_builder_area=\"post_content\"]\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Free Games Club was started under the Community theme to tackle social isolation.<\/span>\n\n[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text module_class=\"tick-list-green\" _builder_version=\"4.15.0\" _module_preset=\"default\" hover_enabled=\"0\" locked=\"off\" global_colors_info=\"{}\" theme_builder_area=\"post_content\" sticky_enabled=\"0\"]\n\nEveryone is welcome to join the club for free.
